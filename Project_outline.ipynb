    "### Cycle flow decay in arbitrary manifolds\n",
    "Our previous work has shown that cycleflow  induces by topologically perturbing a flow network decays as a power law for graphs embedded on Euclidean plane. This work will focus on studying if the decay characteristics differ for graphs embedded on other manifolds. \n",

    "**Flow network:** A flow network is a *graph* through whose vertices certain *input* currents are injected, and those currents are distrbuted through the edges in th form of *flows* according to a *flow model*. \n",

    "**Cycleflows:** When an edge of a flow network is perturbed infinitesimally, the flows along all edges must change. Due to the continuity equation that still must remain valid, these variations in flows must take teh form of cycle flows along each loop.  \n",
